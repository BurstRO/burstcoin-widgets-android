# Burstcoin Widgets

Burstcoin Widgets is a collection of homescreen widgets.

Widgets include:
* Burstcoin Address - View the balance of an address on the Burstcoin network
* Burstcoin Network - View the status of the decentralized Burstcoin network
* Burstcoin Price - View the price in BTC and the Price / Market Capital of BURST in a currency of your choice!

Other Features:
* Select how often the widgets update to either get more up-to-date information or to conserve battery life
* Manually trigger an update of widgets by clicking the Burst logo in order to get fresh data
* Select the node the widgets use for their information so you can make the widgets reflect data from the testnet, or use your own node
* Specify the fiat currency that the Burstcoin price is shown in
